# Reporting to PSF

We need to report to the Python Software Foundation, send copies of conference pictures to them and demographic report after the conference

Sample:

**PyCon 2014**
- Students 13.15%
- Professionals 60.56%
- Sponsors 9.39%
- Speakers 6.10%
- Volunteers 10.80%

**PyCon 2012**
- Students 36.36 %
- Professionals 48.64 %
- Speakers 3.64 %
- Volunteers 11.36 %

We had a turnout of roughly 240 attendees for both conferences.

Here are also some fun pictures from last year:
