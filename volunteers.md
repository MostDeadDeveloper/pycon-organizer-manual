# Volunteers
[WIP]

Example copy for signing up volunteers:

> Thanks for your interest in becoming a volunteer for PyConPH! We can't stress enough that the spirit of volunteerism is what makes the Python community and tech events like PyCon distinctly inspiring. We need all the help we can get.

> You may refer to the [Committees and Responsibilities](https://github.com/pythonph/pycon-organizer-manual/wiki/D.-Committees-and-Responsibilities) section to have an idea of the responsibilities assigned for each committee.

> Once you've decided which committee you'd like to be part of, please fill-out the [volunteer form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SpJgtnp4MoAArCzT_pVj_kxptQR-mL1ts6B_j7xGX0w/viewform) and we'll get in touch with you as soon as we can. Note that volunteer slots per committee are limited so we might put you on wait-list if the volunteer limit for the committee you signed up for has already been reached. 

> Don't be shy, say hi to the PyCon committee on slack and introduce yourself :)
