# Committees and Responsibilities
## PyCon Conference Chair

The conference chair is the main person in charge. Heâ€™s responsible for setting the budget, monitoring expenses and general oversight of all other committees. He works together with the Python.PH Board of Trustees for behind-the-scenes decision making, and to ensure that the conference will be a success.

The conference chair has the final decision and authority with regards to the PyCon.


## Committee Leader

As a committee leader, you are responsible for coordinating to your committee volunteers, identifying tasks that need to be done, proper delegation and providing clear instructions to them.

Each leader has their own management style. But for first-timers or those who are unsure of how to do their roles, we recommend the following:

### Tips for managing volunteers
- Prepare `goals` for your committee. This is in addition to the goals the PyCon Chair assigns to you. These goals should be meant to push your committee to a higher bar.

```This is a psychological trick where you set a target that is beyond the minimum. This will give you greater focus without compromising the minimum requirement.

Boxers also use this technique during training by visualizing their target behind the punching bag. This will make their punches hit harder```

- Constant communication. Set a time and date where you and your team will meet, either online or offline.

- Some volunteers are shy at first. It might be a good idea to meet them for coffee/dinner so you can give them instructions in person and to make them feel more comfortable talking to you.

- Based on experience, one of the best ways to lead an open source community is to lead by example.
