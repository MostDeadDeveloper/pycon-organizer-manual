# Committees and Responsibilities
## PyCon Chair

The conference chair is the main person in charge. Heâ€™s responsible for setting the budget, monitoring expenses and general oversight of all other committees. He works together with the Python.PH Board of Trustees for decision-making and to sort-out stuff behind the scenes.

## Committee Heads

As a committee head, you are responsible for coordinating to your committee members (volunteers for your committee), identifying tasks that need to be done, proper delegation and providing clear instructions to them.

Some volunteers are shy at first. It might be a good idea to meet them for coffee/dinner so you can give them instructions in person and so that they'll feel more comfortable talking to you.

We also found based on experience that one of the best ways to lead an open source community is to lead by example.

Lastly, you rock! Thanks so much for stepping-up! :)
