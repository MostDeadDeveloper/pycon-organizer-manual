## Speakers

It's our priority to make sure we maintain the quality of talks and speakers for PyCon. Talks and workshop must always be related to Python. 

The call for speaker page should contain this line:

"Please note that since this is a volunteer-run, not-for-profit conference, we cannot reimburse your travel costs."

This is to remove expectations that we will shoulder the speakers' traveling expenses. But for the keynotes, it will be on a case-by-case basis if the conference can assist their expenses.

### Keynote Speakers

### Workshop Speakers

### Confirmation of speakers

1. Use president@python.ph to send the approval of speakers. This is to add legitimacy to the letter and to make the speakers feel good that the president themself is sending the letter.
2. Ask in the approval letter if the foreign speaker needs help for the visa.

## Emcees

Here's a checklist of tasks/pointers for PyCon emcees:
- Introduce speakers before their talk
- Mention Sponsors during breaks, welcome and closing remarks, and set-up phase
- Mention Corporate Ticket buyers and recognize the presence of company representatives at PyCon. If possible, ask them to stand so we could give them a round of applause.
- Speak in English so we can make our foreign guests feel welcome.
- Follow the [Code of Conduct](http://ph.pycon.org/coc.html)
- As closing, wish the attendees a safe trip home and we'll see them tomorrow (if day 1) or we'll see them again next year.
