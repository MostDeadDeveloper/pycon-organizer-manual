# pycon-organizer-manual
RTD for organizing the yearly Python Conference in the Philippines (PyConPH)

For first 2 PyCons (PyCon 2012 and PyCon 2014), we sort of went on a "think on your feet" mode and relied heavily on email/IRC/slack for communicating stuff. It takes a while for people to get into context and we don't avoid repeating ourselves. The purpose of this manual is to address volunteer concerns such as "I signed up for the X committee, but Iâ€™m not sure where to proceed."

Here you may also find a list of contact points and links to some useful resources for volunteering for PyConPH.
