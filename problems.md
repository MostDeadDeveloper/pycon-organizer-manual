# Problems Encountered and Possible Solutions

This page will serve as documentation for the problems encountered in previous PyCons and what are the suggested solutions/workarounds.

## Late start of the program

This happened on PyCon 2014. Reasoning were: Late breakfast and late registrations (a line was formed).

Solution: Use registration programs to identify the ticket holders instead of manually registering.
Solution: Choose a breakfast that can be brought the night before.
Solution: Put in the program that the PyCon will start strictly on time.

## An audience member unintentionally insulted a Muslim

Situation: During the Lightning Talk of PyCon 2014, a presenter prayed in front of the audience (as part of their program). A Muslim did not appreciate that (with good reason).

Solution: Have all of the audience agree to the Code of Conduct
Solution: Have the stage-hand committee monitor the audience during the event and approach appropriately.
Solution: For the lightning talk presenters, remind them about the conduct and summarize to them what is acceptable and what is not.
Solution: Have the stage-hand turn off the mic in case COC is broken. Feign technical difficulties.

## No blog post for PyCon 2014

Situation: The entire volunteers at PyCon 2014 was exhausted. No one had the strength to make a post.

Solution: Make the blog during the event.
Solution: Assign someone to blog.

## Missing a foreign speaker

Situation: We had a foreign speaker who missed PyCon because we weren't able to supply needed information in time.

Solution: Contact the foreign speaker at least 6 weeks prior to PyCon and ask for the following:
- Passport Origin
- Passport ID
- Details for incoming flight (airline company and flight number)
- Details for outgoing flight (airline company and flight number)
- Hotel reservations. More likely, we will be looking for a hotel for them to stay in. But if they have a hotel in mind, we can accommodate.
- Letter for their company confirming our acceptance of their talk (must be sent via president@python.ph to give weight and formality when forwarded to their company)
- "Is there anything you'll need from us to ensure that you'll be able to attend PyCon.PH <year>?"


## Overtime

Situation: Some talks went over their time w/c cascaded into delays

Solution: Add buffer time between talks and enforce talk schedules
