# Fund-raising

Just like any other endeavor, we need funding to bring our ideas to life. Conferences incur big expenses such as the venue, food, logistics etc. 

PyCon PH strives for the diversity of its audience -- we can't achieve that if our tickets are too expensive.

## Sponsors
Looking for sponsors can be tedious. Getting as many as possible involved in the process can go a long way. Create letter templates for prospective sponsors and have a team send them out. It might be tempting to automate this but it's better if you don't. _TODO: explain why_

Start early! Allot at least 4 months before the event for getting sponsors.

## Sponsorship packages
It's always hard to ask for money. Sponsorship packages help us avoid the negotiating dance. Have a least 3 tiers and expect some companies to request for different benefits.
