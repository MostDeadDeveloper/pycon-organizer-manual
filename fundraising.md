# Fund-raising

Just like any other endeavor, we need funding to bring our ideas to life. Conferences incur big expenses such as the venue, food, logistics etc. 

PyCon PH strives for the diversity of its audience -- we can't achieve that if our tickets are too expensive.

Starting early is key for a successful fund-raising campaign. Allot at least 4 months before the event for getting sponsors.
