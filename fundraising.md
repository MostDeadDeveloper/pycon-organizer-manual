# Fundraising

Just like any other endeavor, we need funding to bring our ideas to life.

Conferences are normally expensive since we have to pay for things such as the venue, food, logistics etc. 

One of the main goals of Python conferences though is the diversity of its audience -- we can't accomplish that if our tickets are too expensive.

The people in charge of fundraising are usually the ones who put countless of hours and effort in making sure we can deliver the conference to the widest audience possible by driving down the ticket costs for PyCon with the help of our generous sponsors.
