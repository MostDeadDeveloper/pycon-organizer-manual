# What is PyCon Philippines (PyCon PH)?

[PyCon Philippines](http://pycon.python.ph/) is a [volunteer-run](http://pycon.python.ph/volunteers.html), not-for-profit conference centered around the Python Programming language. The conference provides a venue for Python and surrounding technologies to be explored, discussed and exercised. We gather people from different walks of life in a 2-day event where we can collaborate and learn together.
