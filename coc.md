# Code of Conduct
We follow a [Code of Conduct for PyConPH](https://github.com/pythonph/pycon-2015/blob/master/coc.rst) and make sure all attendees and volunteers abide by it.

We also normally ask volunteers to read the [Python Software Foundation's Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/) and make sure they understand, [sign](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mky-a8ZQ8b9kLvE0bwURETJWHX0opO2tTBleRzcdW3g/viewform) and agree to it before they proceed.

This is so we can plan the conference around the same ideals and be able to enforce a code of conduct after having seen that the PyConPH core team (committee heads, volunteers) themselves follow it.
